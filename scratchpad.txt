CHEAT-SHEET:
============
- grep -E "class|def" app/tests.py - Command to check the list of unit tests

GUIDELINES:
===========
- Flow is to create a "broken state" (a test with an expected fail), do the minimum code to go to a "working state" (all tests pass) and then refactor the code as needed (refactor tests or app code but not both at the same time)

- One file (and one class) per user story
- One file for each of test_views / test_models / test_templates

TODOs:
======
- Eliminate hardcoded URLs from views.py
- Eliminate hardcoded URLs from list.html and home.html
